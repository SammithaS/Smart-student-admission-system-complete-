The present trend is to digitize the systems and the admission process in academic institutions (universities, colleges, etc.) is also more digitized than ever. Everything is carried out through online processes, from standardized tests to application processing, shortlisting on the basis of merit, and even document verification. However, in spite of having huge benefits in terms of convenience, existing admission processes severely need more transparency. The entire process is dependent on certain central authoritative entities such as the testing authorities followed by the institutes themselves. This project presents a Smart System for Students' Admission to College, integrating blockchain and AI technologies. The system comprises three main components: document verification, AI authentication, and seat allotment. The project employs Ethereum blockchain, Solidity for smart contracts, Inter Planetary File System (IPFS) and SHA-256 hashing algorithm for document verification, and MERN stack for seat allotment. The report discusses the technology stack, and system architecture, implementation and also presents insights derived from relevant research papers.
